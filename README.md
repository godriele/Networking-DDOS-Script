# Networking-DDOS-Script

# Overview
This script demonstrates a basic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. It floods a target server with numerous requests, aiming to overload its resources and make it unresponsive to legitimate users.

### Note: This script is intended strictly for educational purposes and should not be used for malicious activities. Unauthorized use can have severe legal and ethical consequences.

## How It Works
Multiple Threads: The script creates 500 threads, each executing the attack() function. This simulates multiple systems sending requests to the target server simultaneously.

Flooding the Target: Each thread opens a TCP connection to the target server's specified port (port 80, commonly used for HTTP) and sends malformed HTTP GET requests with a fake Host header.

Resource Overload: The server tries to handle the high volume of incoming requests, leading to resource exhaustion, degraded performance, or downtime.

## Impact
Service Disruption: The targeted server may become slow or entirely unresponsive.
Resource Consumption: The target's CPU, memory, and network bandwidth may be overwhelmed.
Business Consequences: 
Such an attack can harm the targetâ€™s reputation, lead to revenue loss, and disrupt services for legitimate users.

# Script Breakdown
### Modules Used:
socket: For creating socket connections.
threading: To run multiple attack threads concurrently.
### Key Variables:

target: The IP address of the target server (default: '10.0.0.138'). Ensure you have authorization before testing on any server.
fake_ip: A sample IP address ('182.21.20.32') used in the fake Host header.
port: The target port (default: 80).

## Function: attack()
The core function that performs the attack:

Creates a socket and connects to the target server.
Sends a malformed HTTP GET request and a fake Host header.
Closes the socket and repeats the process indefinitely.
Thread Initialization
The script starts 500 threads, each running the attack() function to simulate a large-scale attack.

Legal and Ethical Considerations
DDoS attacks are illegal in many countries and are considered a serious cybercrime. Unauthorized use of this script can lead to:

## Legal action: Fines, imprisonment, or other legal penalties.
## Ethical violations: Harm to businesses, individuals, and the overall integrity of the internet.

## Usage Instructions
Educational Purpose Only: This script is meant for learning about cybersecurity concepts and should be used in a controlled, legal environment.

Do Not Target Unauthorized Systems: Only test this script on servers you own or have explicit permission to test.

Use Virtual Labs: For safe experimentation, use virtual environments or lab setups specifically designed for security testing.
